Requirements:

Introduction:

This project is mainly depends on the maintaining a specific heat in the vechicle seats. It consists of mainly check whether the person is sitting in the seat or not, person is adjusting the temperature depending on the requirement and finally display the temperature of the vechicle seat.

Features:

- Check the user is sitting or not by using the system.
- User chance to adjust the temperature based on the requirement.
- Display the temperature adjustments in the system.

SWOT ANALYSIS:

Strengths:

- Easy to operate.
- User friendly.
- Efficient operation.

Weakness:

- System is only required for the cold countries.
- Limited applications.

Opportunities:

- Used for Increasing temperature of the vechicle seat.

Threats:

- This system is not required for the high temperature countries.

4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H:

What:

- Vechicle seat temperature monitoring and adjusting system.

Where:

- Used in the Cold temperatures.

When:

- Requirement for the increasing the seat temperature in the vechicle.

Why:

- By increasing the temperature of the seat ,user get comfortable and performance will improved.

How:

- Firstly check the user in or out and then after adjust the temperature based on the user requirement and finally Display the adjusted seat temperature.
